# Next Word Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques. The model takes a sequence of words as input and predicts the most probable next word based on learned patterns from a given dataset.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, cleaning, padding).
- Use of **Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or Transformer embeddings).
- Training a **Neural Network** model (e.g., LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based model).
- Model evaluation and testing on sample sentences.
- Interactive user input for real-time word prediction.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras nltk
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook next_word_prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and test predictions.
3. Modify the input text in the interactive section to get next-word predictions.

## Dataset
The model requires a large corpus of text data. You can use datasets like:
- Wikipedia corpus
- OpenSubtitles dataset
- Custom text data

## Future Improvements
- Implementing transformer-based models like **GPT** for better predictions.
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets for more accurate results.
- Deploying as an API for real-time predictions.
